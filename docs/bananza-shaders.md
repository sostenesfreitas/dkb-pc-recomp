# Bananza shaders (base 1.0.0)

Notes on the NVN 2 shader format and on how DKB Recomp turns the game's Ampere shaders into SPIR-V. The plan is in
[bananza-plan.md](bananza-plan.md); open shader work is in the issues labelled
[area: shaders](https://github.com/Lucas-blip-png/dkb-pc-recomp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22area%3A+shaders%22).

## Where the shaders are

- RomFS `Shader/`: `SilverStarMaterial...Nin_Ounce_NVN2.bfsha.zs` (12.2 MB zstd, most of them),
  `Project...release.sarc.zs` (660 KB) and `PhotoFilter...bfsha.zs` (14 KB). "Ounce" is the Switch 2 code name.
- `bfsha` is an `FSHA` container with `BNSH` inside (and `grsc`), the same format family as on Switch 1. What changes is
  the GPU code inside the BNSH: Ampere instead of Maxwell.
- `Lib/sead/primitive_renderer/primitive_drawer_nvn_shader.bin` (7168 bytes) and `..._nvn2_shader.bin` (6912 bytes)
  are the same shader compiled for NVN 1 (Maxwell) and NVN 2 (Ampere): a Rosetta stone, since TotK Recomp's Maxwell
  translator already understands the first. Both carry the NVN control magic `0x98761234` at +0x10; the next field is
  `0x01` for NVN 1 and `0xC9` for NVN 2.

## The NVN 2 control section

The layout differs completely from NVN 1's. Fields known so far, over the 2,656 stages of the game's corpus
(`DKB_SHADER_DUMP`, see `runtime/gfx_shader.c`, `gfx_shader_nvn2_dump`):

| Offset | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| +0x00 | Magic `0x98761234` |
| +0x04 | Version `0xC9` (201); NVN 1 has 1 |
| +0x08 | `0xB` (2,626 stages) or `0x7` (30); not the stage |
| +0x0C | `0x000E0170`, constant (target, probably SM86) |
| +0x20..+0x2C | 128-bit hash (1,907 distinct) |
| +0x30 | Control size, `0xD8` in the game (`0x930` in sead); repeated at +0x98, +0xC4, +0xC8. 182 stages leave it 0 and are treated as `0xD8` |
| +0x38 | Code size |
| +0x40, +0x44 | Inline constants (bank 1) follow the code from +0x40 to +0x44 (`runtime/nvn2_lower.cpp`) |
| +0x4C | Small (0x24..0x48): likely the register count |
| +0x54, +0x60 | Multiples of 0x1000 |
| +0x64 | Compute shared memory size |
| +0xA4 | `0x1000000`, constant |
| +0xB1, +0xB2, +0xB3, +0xB6 | Compute bank counts: uniform buffers, storage buffers, textures, images (`NVN2_C0_LAYOUT` in `runtime/gfx_shader.c`) |

The Ampere code starts right away, without NVN 1's `0x12345678` header, as 128-bit instructions (SM70 and later).
Graphics stages begin with a version 4 SPH (32 words, 0x80 bytes, as in Mesa NAK `sph.rs`): word 0 bits 0-4 are the
SPH type (1 VTG, 2 PS), bits 5-9 the version (4), bits 10-13 the shader type (1 vertex, 5 pixel). Compute stages have
no SPH. The corpus holds 1,460 vertex, 1,138 pixel and 58 compute stages.

`nvdisasm -b SM86 -raw` (CUDA toolkit 13.4.92) disassembles the code after the SPH cleanly. The sead vertex shader:
`ALD.96 a[0x80]` / `ALD a[0xa0]`, two 4x4 matrices from `c[0x4]` and `c[0x3]` (`FMUL`/`FFMA`/`FADD .FTZ`),
`AST.128 a[0x80]` (colour), `AST.128 a[0x70]` (position), `EXIT`. Attributes keep the classic layout (a[0x70] position,
a[0x80] and up generic), so Ryujinx's Maxwell mapping applies.

## From Ampere to SPIR-V

`nvnProgramSetShaders` → `runtime/nvn2_lower.cpp` → Eglantine's Ampere-to-Maxwell lowering
(`runtime/third_party/eglantine/`) → Maxwell code plus a synthetic NVN 1 control section → TotK Recomp's translator
(`totk_xlate`, Ryujinx's shader translator with the patches in `tools/xlate/patches/`) → SPIR-V. Offline, the same path
runs with `tools/dkb_lower_test.cpp` and `totk_xlate jobs.json`.

Fixes on top of Eglantine are marked "DKB Recomp" in its files. The ones that mattered most:

- closing the lowered program with a group of Maxwell `EXIT`s (855 `IndexOutOfRange` in the translator's decoder);
- the self-branch end marker, which otherwise became `while (true)`;
- bit 32 of `BRA` is the `.U` flag, not part of the offset (173 stages failed on branch alignment);
- `ULDC.U8/S8/U16/S16`, `I2F.U16` from a uniform register, `I2F.U8` of any byte, `FRND` with a constant buffer
  source, `S2R SR_THREAD_KILL`.

Result: every stage of the first 3D scene lowers and translates (4,820 of 4,820). The translator side also clamps every
shared and local memory index (patch 0013), because the game's neural upscaler reads shared memory out of bounds
([#9](https://github.com/Lucas-blip-png/dkb-pc-recomp/issues/9)).

## Replaying a failed translation locally

Set `DKB_SHADER_FAILURE_DUMP` to an absolute path under an ignored `build/` directory before launching the game.
Each failed translator request gets an exclusively claimed `capture-<process>-<sequence>` directory there, holding
`<key>.request.json`, `<key>.failed.code` and `<key>.error.txt`.
The request preserves the actual draw/host answers and inline constants; the code is the lowered Maxwell input.
Normal cache cleanup stays enabled. Existing packets stay unchanged, including when multiple runtimes share the
dump directory; an incomplete older packet does not block a new capture. Native Ampere input capture remains
the separate `DKB_SHADER_DUMP` option.

Replay one packet without the game or GPU:

```text
python tools/replay_shader_failure.py build/shader-failures/<capture>/<key>.request.json --translator build/xlate/totk_xlate.exe --out build/shader-replay
```

The tool sets `DMSH_STACK=1` for the translator child and retains its reply and stack output in `reply.txt` and
`stderr.txt` under `--out`. It uses the captured sibling `.failed.code` file, so the original temporary cache path may be gone.
Use the same translator executable/identity when reproducing a report. Packets and replay output contain game-derived
code or constants: keep them local and out of commits and public attachments. The option is off by default.

## Constant banks

- **c0, driver bank.** Graphics stages use NVN 1's layout (vertex storage buffers at 0x110, pixel at 0x510). Compute
  is packed per program from the control counts (`runtime/nvn2_c0.h`): a 0x10 head, the eight root tables the game
  pushes with `nvnCommandBufferPushComputeConstants`, each padded to 16 bytes (word counts at control +0xa9..+0xb0),
  the uniform buffer and storage buffer tables, then texture and image handles. The upscaler's root table 0 holds its
  two image rectangles (#20).
- **c1**: the inline constants after the code.
- **c2**: combined texture handles at 0x20 + 8 × slot, as in NVN 1.
- **c24**: read only by full-screen blit shaders (3 vertex, 2 pixel), at offsets 0x0 to 0xc. Maxwell has 18 banks, so
  the lowering moves it to bank 17, and the host fills bank 17 with a blit block computed from the render area
  (`runtime/vk_exec_draw.c`, the `slot == 17` branch; Eglantine's `BlitConstantsPass`). NVN 2 push constants are
  written as Ampere root tables, one per stage, and bank 24 is the likely place shaders read them from; if so, the game
  supplies these values itself. See [#2](https://github.com/Lucas-blip-png/dkb-pc-recomp/issues/2).

## Still to handle

From Eglantine's `NX2_NOTES` and our runs: ASTC with the Switch 2 GOB swizzle (TotK Recomp's deswizzle is the Switch 1
one), mesh and task shaders (`ISBEWR`/`ISBERD`), 8192×8192×68 ASTC virtual textures (sparse allocation), and `IPA`
interpolation modes. The NVN 2 command buffer calls the host does not record yet are listed in
[#6](https://github.com/Lucas-blip-png/dkb-pc-recomp/issues/6).
