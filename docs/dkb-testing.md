# Testing DKB Recomp

This guide is for running DKB Recomp on your own PC and reporting what happens. You build it from source with your own
copy of the game. Nothing from the game is in this repository, and nothing you build from it may be shared: not the
executable, not the generated code, not the shader cache.

## What you need

- Windows 10 or 11 on an x86-64 CPU with AVX2.
- 16 GB of RAM plus a large page file (32 GB is comfortable). The game commits about 14 GB (13.5 GiB at the start, 13.75 GiB after 40 minutes in the tutorial and first mine,
  rising about 6 MB per minute, peak 15.3 GiB; sessions over an hour are untested), so close other large programs first.
- A GPU with Vulkan 1.3 and a current driver.
- About 15 GB free for the build (the packed RomFS is about 9 GB), besides the space your dump takes.
- *Donkey Kong Bananza* base version 1.0.0, dumped from your own Switch 2: the ExeFS (`main`, `sdk`, `main.npdm`) and
  the RomFS as a folder. Update 458752 is not supported yet. This project does not explain how to dump the game.
  If your dump is a single `.nup` file (the container Eglantine and Eden load), `tools/extract_nup.py` writes both
  folders from its base package: `python tools\extract_nup.py <game>.nup --list` shows the packages, and
  `python tools\extract_nup.py <game>.nup --out build\extracted\dkb100-dump` writes `exefs` and `romfs` there, checking
  every file's SHA-256. Pass those two folders to the commands in the README.

## Build

Install the toolchain from [building.md](building.md) (MSYS2 UCRT64 Clang, Ninja, Python 3.12 in `.venv`, .NET SDK),
then run the commands in the README, "Building from source". The executable ends up in `build\dkb100\dkb.exe`.

The generation command must include `--patches recomp\patches-dkb100.txt`. This enables the controller setup patch
that bypasses the game's HID server proxy, which the host does not implement. If you generated the code without
that argument, rerun the README's generation command with it and then rebuild with `tools\build_game.py`.
Rebuilding alone leaves the unpatched generated code in place and the game stops during controller setup.

## Run

```
build\dkb100\dkb.exe
```

Run it from inside the repository: it finds the shader translator (`build\xlate\totk_xlate.exe`) by looking up from
its own folder. The first run translates every shader it meets and is slow; later runs use the cache.

Prepare the shaders once (the Bananza installer does this as its `dkb_shaders` step): the game's own shader files hold
about 18,800 shader stages, and translating one the first time a draw needs it takes about 35 ms, with the draw waiting.
On a first visit to an area that adds up to seconds. These two steps translate them all up front, from your own game
files:

```
.venv\Scripts\python tools\dkb_shader_census.py --version dkb100 --out build\dkb100
build\dkb100\dkb.exe --prepare-shaders
```

The first reads the shader folders of the extracted RomFS (4 seconds) and writes `seed-nvn2.bin` (about 187 MiB) next to
`dkb.exe`; the second lowers and translates every stage into the shader cache. Each stage is translated with the default
answers (every texture a 2D texture, float vertex inputs and colour outputs), and each vertex stage again for the integer
vertex layouts met so far (Locations 6, 6 and 7, 3 and 4) plus any layout your own `shader-answers.bin` recorded. That
takes about 150 seconds on 20 threads and about 2.9 GB of cache. The pack is deleted afterwards by the installer.
`--prepare-shaders` also builds the driver's pipeline libraries in the same process. The installer instead runs
`--translate-shaders` (translation only) and then `--warm-shaders` (libraries only), so a driver crash in the second
cannot fail the first.

In a cold run of the first area this cut the shaders translated during play from 714 to 62, the worst translation stall
from 6.6 s to 0.34 s, and the 1% low of the last window from 24 to 39 fps. What is left is about 1.4% of the stages the
game loads: 38 embedded in `main` and about 50 whose code is in no file the census reads. They translate on first use, and
play records them. `DKB_ANSWER_STATS=1` logs each translation made in play with what made it necessary.

Useful settings, as environment variables (`set NAME=value` in the same Command Prompt):

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `TOTK_PROFILE_DIR=<folder>` | Use this folder for the save and settings. A new, empty folder gives a fresh start, which is what reports should use. |
| `TOTK_GPU_NAME=<text>` | Use the first GPU whose name contains this text, on machines with more than one. |
| `TOTK_GPU=null` | Run without a picture (no Vulkan). Useful to tell CPU and OS bugs from graphics bugs. |
| `TOTK_XLATE_PROCS=<n>` | Shader translator processes at run time (default 2). Lower it if RAM runs out. |
| `TOTK_TRACE=perf` | Log the frame time, what holds frames back and the GPU time every 60 frames. For stalls and low frame rates. |
| `TOTK_PERF_SLOW_GPU_MS=<ms>` | With `TOTK_TRACE=perf`, a replay part that runs this long on the GPU (default 100) gets a line with its draw and dispatch counts and the NVN 2 names of its stages, a second line with the arguments of its indirect draws as read back afterwards, and a third saying whether a shader in that part wrote the largest one's arguments, and which. |
| `TOTK_FIX_INDIRECT_RESET=0` | Draws the terrain's indirect-record reset program as a shader instead of the host doing its stores (#48). The shader's stores are lost, so the records keep zero or stale contents; for comparisons only. |
| `TOTK_EXPERIMENTAL_GEOMETRY=1` | Replays draws with an ordinary geometry stage through it (#52). Off by default; other geometry draws are rejected once in the log. |
| `TOTK_NATIVE_GS=0` (or `DKB_NATIVE_GS=0`) | Turns off the replay of the game's native passthrough geometry stages on the portable path. That replay draws the destructible terrain (#45) and is on by default; with it off the terrain is black. The varyings are inferred, not read from the hardware skip mask. |
| `TOTK_REC_BATCH=N` (or `DKB_REC_BATCH=N`) | Publishes the Vulkan recorder ring's head every N packets (1..64) instead of after each one (#93), so the recorder thread's spin reads a cache line the producer rewrites less often. 0 (default) publishes after every packet. Waits and handoffs publish the rest. With large N the last packets are recorded inside the final drain while the submitting thread waits, so watch `drain_ms` in `TOTK_TRACE=perf`; start with 8. |
| `TOTK_POOL_FINI_WAIT=idle\|fence` (or `DKB_POOL_FINI_WAIT`) | What releasing a used memory pool waits for before the game gets the storage back. `idle` (default) idles the whole graphics queue; `fence` waits only for the newest finished submission on the timeline and does nothing when it is already done; it covers the work the game has synchronized on, not the parts already submitted for the submission still being recorded. A level change frees many pools one after another, and a `TOTK_PROFILE_SLOW` dump of a 1.6 s frame showed five guest threads in turn in the idle wait. With either value the log gets a `used pool ... released` line for each release that waited over 10 ms (the first 64). |
| `TOTK_HOST_PROPS_CACHE=0` (or `DKB_HOST_PROPS_CACHE=0`) | Asks `vkGetMemoryHostPointerPropertiesEXT` for every imported memory pool instead of keeping the first answer for the others (the default). The first answer is assumed to hold for every guest pool (all are plain committed read/write memory); if `vkAllocateMemory` fails with the kept answer, the query is made for that pool and the import is tried once more. On NVIDIA the query took long for the big pools of a level change, with several guest threads in it in turn (1.8 s in a `TOTK_PROFILE_SLOW` dump). A query that takes over 10 ms is logged with the pool size (the first 16); a `vkAllocateMemory` import that takes over 10 ms is logged too (the first 32). |
| `DKB_GEOMETRY_CONTEXT=1` | Logs the first 12 draws with a geometry stage and their buffers (#58). `DKB_GEOMETRY_CONTEXT_ORIGIN=<hex>` keeps only draws with that stage origin. |
| `DKB_GPU_CHECKPOINTS=1` | On NVIDIA (VK_NV_device_diagnostic_checkpoints), marks every pipeline bind, compute dispatch, copy, blit and colour clear so that a lost device logs the last checkpoints the GPU reached, with the NVN 2 names of the shaders of each pipeline (#75). With VK_EXT_device_address_binding_report it also keeps the last 4096 GPU address bind/unbind events and, for each address in the device fault report, logs the bindings that contain it or the nearest one ending within 1 MiB below it. Also saves the driver's fault dump to `logs\dkb-fault-<time>.bin`; it can contain shader code, never attach it. With VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties it also logs, the first time a pipeline is bound, one line per driver executable (stage, NVN 2 stage names, every statistic such as binary size) and saves its internal representation (ISA) to `logs\dkb-isa-<pipeline handle>-<stage>.txt` (or `.bin`; at most 4096 pipelines and 512 MiB; derived from the game, never attach). The capture runs on the recorder thread at each new pipeline's first bind, so it can slow recording, and toggling the variable costs one cold pipeline-cache run. Off by default. AMD always has its own breadcrumbs. |
| `DKB_SKIP_VS=<origin>[,<origin>...]`, `DKB_SKIP_FS=<origin>[,<origin>...]` | Debug only, for diagnosing #75: skips every draw whose NVN 2 vertex (`DKB_SKIP_VS`) or fragment (`DKB_SKIP_FS`) stage origin (the 16-digit hex name logged by `DKB_GPU_CHECKPOINTS=1`) is listed, up to 16. Off by default. |
| `DKB_DUMP_SPV=1` | Debug only, for diagnosing #75: writes the exact SPIR-V passed to `vkCreateShaderModule` for each graphics and compute shader (after every rewrite) to `spv/<vs\|fs\|gs\|cs>-<NVN 2 stage origin>-<FNV-1a 64>.spv` next to `dkb.log`, so a SPIR-V hash from an Nsight Aftermath dump maps to its NVN 2 stage; up to 1 GiB, one `vk: spv dump` log line per file. Off by default. The files can hold code derived from the game: never attach them. |
| `DKB_SPV_OVERRIDE=<hash>:<path.spv>[,<hash>:<path.spv>...]` | Debug only, for #75: a shader module whose final SPIR-V has this FNV-1a 64 hash (16 hex digits, the last part of a `DKB_DUMP_SPV` file name) is created from the given file instead (multiple of 4 bytes, up to 16 MiB; max 8 entries). One `vk: SPIR-V override` log line per replaced module. Off by default. |
| `DKB_FMZ=0`, `vertex` (default) or `all` | Workaround for #75, on for vertex stages by default (`0` turns it off): rewrites 32-bit float `OpFMul` and GLSL.std.450 `Fma` in the final SPIR-V so `0 * x = 0` even for Inf and NaN (NVIDIA's fused-multiply-zero rule). `vertex` touches vertex-stage modules only, `all` every stage. One `vk: FMZ rewrite <hash> mul=<n> fma=<m>` log line per rewritten module; `DKB_DUMP_SPV` shows the rewritten bytes. `DKB_FMZ_SEL=<mask>:<value>` (hex) limits it to the modules whose FNV-1a 64 hash before the rewrite satisfies `(hash & mask) == value`, so `1:0` and `1:1` split the set in halves for a bisection. |
| `TOTK_TRACE=codec` | Log each call of the video decoder that moves a buffer or a picture. For guide movies that stop or show a flat colour. |

The settings keep TotK Recomp's `TOTK_` names, so its fixes apply without a rename. Each one can also be written with
`DKB_` in its place (`DKB_GPU=null`); when both are set, the `DKB_` one wins.

Command-line options: `--seconds S` stops the run after S seconds of game time, and `--shot frame.png` with it saves
that frame. A shot is for your own debugging; do not post it if it shows game content.

## Experimental ultrawide mode

Bananza 1.0.0 supports an optional wider horizontal camera view with proportional UI.
The title/main-menu background fills the wider viewport: its wall and atmosphere are
enlarged uniformly and cropped vertically, while the logo and text keep their proportions.
Corner HUD elements, including saving/loading indicators, can move to the screen edges
or remain in a centered 16:9 area. Menu controls and world markers remain centered.

Open F1 → Screen to set **Ultrawide**, **Render resolution**, and **HUD position**.
Ultrawide is off by default; HUD placement defaults to **Screen edges** when enabled.
All three settings currently require a restart. Available resolution presets are:

| Ultrawide | Aspect-ratio group | Presets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Off | 16:9 | 1280x720, 1600x900, 1920x1080, 2560x1440, 2880x1620 |
| On | 21:9 class | 2560x1080, 3440x1440 |
| On | 32:9 | 3840x1080 |

The original virtual-display functions return 2880x1620 (16:9); this remains the
default when no resolution is selected. These dimensions do not establish the native
3D rendering resolution or the Switch 2 screen's resolution. Window size controls the
host window separately. Use **Black bars** (`DKB_ASPECT=fit`) to preserve proportions
when the window and game have different aspect ratios.

Build with `recomp/patches-dkb100.txt` and generate matching overlays from your own packed
RomFS (requires Python `zstandard`). For a 3440x1440 build, generate both HUD variants:

```powershell
python tools/dkb_wide_layout.py --romfs build/extracted/dkb100-packed/romfs --out build/ultrawide/romfs-patches-3440x1440 --aspect 3440x1440
python tools/dkb_wide_layout.py --romfs build/extracted/dkb100-packed/romfs --out build/ultrawide/romfs-patches-3440x1440-hud-edges --aspect 3440x1440 --hud edges
build/ultrawide/dkb.exe
```

Repeat for each installed ultrawide resolution, placing the folders beside `romfs-index.bin`.
The overlays contain game data and must stay private under `build/`. Regenerate older
overlays to include the title-background fix; updating the executable alone is insufficient.
Missing edge-HUD overlays fall back to the centered variant with a log message.

Environment equivalents are `DKB_ULTRAWIDE=0|1`, `DKB_OUTPUT_RES=<width>x<height>`,
and `DKB_HUD_POSITION=edges|centered`. Overrides lock the corresponding F1 controls;
otherwise choices are saved in `dkb.ini` (an existing `totk.ini` is copied to it on the first run; `TOTK_*` environment variables still work, and `DKB_*` ones win over them). Turning Ultrawide off allows the 16:9 presets
and skips the wide overlay. Invalid sizes fall back to the original 2880x1620 dimensions.

5120x1440 (32:9) and 3840x2160 failed during render-resource creation and are excluded
from the menu. Diagnostic overrides can accept larger sizes but do not establish support.
Coverage remains limited to short Windows/NVIDIA runs; other scenes and GPUs need testing.

Run the layout, projection/register-preservation, and configuration checks with:

```powershell
python tests/dkb_wide_layout_test.py
python tests/dkb_wide_projection_test.py
clang -O2 -march=x86-64-v3 -I runtime tests/dkb_wide_test.c -o build/dkb-wide-test.exe
build/dkb-wide-test.exe
build/ultrawide/dkb.exe --probe-cfg
```

## What to report

Open an issue with the issue form, or comment on [#3](https://github.com/Lucas-blip-png/dkb-pc-recomp/issues/3)
(GPU testing) or [#7](https://github.com/Lucas-blip-png/dkb-pc-recomp/issues/7) (playing further):

- the commit you built (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`);
- GPU, driver version and Windows version;
- how far the game got and what you did just before it stopped;
- the log, `logs\dkb.log` next to `dkb.exe` (`logs\totk.log` in builds before the rename), as an attachment. After a crash, copy it before you start the game
  again: the next run renames it to `dkb.1.log`.

Never attach game files, keys, builds or the shader cache, and never paste key values into a log or an issue.
